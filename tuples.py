# tuple is just like a list but without square brackets!
# main difference is that tuples are immutables - lists are not.

# basically - tuples you cannot change (add/remove etc) 
# lists you can change...(add/remove etc)

monday_temperatures = {1, 4, 5}

list_temperatures = [1, 4, 5]

# you can add to lists
list_temperatures.append(6)

print(list_temperatures)
print(monday_temperatures)
